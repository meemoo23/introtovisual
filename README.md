Above are all my files for the tetris project, showing my progress through the game. Everytime there is a new project file, it means I ran into a problem and wanted to save before continuing. 

I learnt a lot from not only the assignments in class (even if i was not very good at them) but I heavily credit multiple sources from youtube for demonstrating not only the code but the explanations to all the 
workings in a game. 

In the folder 'tetris project final', you will see all of the game codes along with the 3 sound files (music, rotation sound, and clear sounds) as well as the font used.

I had a really enjoyable time making this game and learning what it means to create one but also how - i'd love to make another one in my spare time too!

Thank you so much for a really enjoyable semester, I've learnt a lot and I know I'll continue to use these skills in the future!

(Also thank you for putting up with my useless-ness at times!)
